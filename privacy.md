#Privacy Policy

##Location Data

###We request your location to calculate the time it will take to return to your parking meter. We do not store or persist your location data in any form, and it is discarded immediately after the meter warning is canceled or when a new warning is created.

##Debugging Data

###We use Apple’s opt-in service for crash reporting. Your device, version of iOS and the date of when the crash occurred will be viewable by us. However, no personally identifiable information is kept by us or sent externally. The only things we will see are what steps were taken before the crash occurred. We will not see any of the data you’ve entered such as the name of your lists, items, notes or images.

##Personal Data

###Put simply, nothing you enter in Sweeping Reminders is ever viewable by us. For debugging purposes, we may ask you to provide this kind of information to troubleshoot an issue. Otherwise, it is written directly to your device and any data that’s synced is done so via Apple’s iCloud services and is not accessible to us.

##Any Questions?

###If you have any questions at all about your data, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We’re happy to answer anything!

# Privacy Policy

### Location Data

We request your location to calculate the time it will take to return to your parking meter. We do not store or persist your location data in any form, and it is discarded immediately after the meter warning is canceled or when a new warning is created.

### Debugging Data

We use Apple’s opt-in service for crash reporting. Your device, version of iOS and the date of when the crash occurred will be viewable by us. However, no personally identifiable information is kept by us or sent externally. The only things we will see are what steps were taken before the crash occurred. We will not see any of the data you’ve entered such as the name of your lists, items, notes or images.

### Personal Data

Put simply, nothing you enter in Sweeping Reminders is ever viewable by us. For debugging purposes, we may ask you to provide this kind of information to troubleshoot an issue. Otherwise, it is written directly to your device and any data that’s synced is done so via Apple’s iCloud services and is not accessible to us.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.

### Conditions of Use
IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE APPLICATION.

### Any Questions?

If you have any questions at all about your data, please don’t hesitate to contact us.

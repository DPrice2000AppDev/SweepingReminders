# Coming Soon to the Apple App Store
## Sweeping Reminders is a tool to help you avoid fees and tickets.

### Street Sweeping - Can't figure out when the street sweeper is coming?  The app contains a calendar view to show you when street sweeping is scheduled.  It also notifies you the day before.
### Parking Meters - Not sure if you can get back to the car before your parking meter expires?  The app uses Apple's walking directions to figure out how long it will take to return to the meter.  It notifies you when you need to return to the car, with a little time to spare.  
### Garage Fees - Can't figure out how much the parking garage is going to charge?  Our calculator will tell you the total fee now and in the future.
